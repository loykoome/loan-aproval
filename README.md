i) Overview

The project aims to predict whether a loan application will be approved based on multiple factors such as applicant's income, credit score and employment status. 
Model is built using supervised learning techniques and provides insights into the factors influencing loan approval decisions.

ii) Features

- Predict loan approval status (approved or denied)
- Support for multiple machine learning algorithms including logistic regression, decision trees and random forests
- Performance evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score metrics
- Comprehensive data preprocessing and feature engineering

iii) Requirements

This project required Python 3.7 or higher. The following Python packages are needed:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- jupyter (optional, for running notebooks)

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter

 ## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/loykoome/loan-prediction-approval.git
   cd loan-prediction-approval
   

2. Install the required packages:

   pip install -r requirements.txt


 ## Usage

1. Prepare the Data: Placed my dataset in the `data/` directory. Ensured it is in a format compatible with the provided scripts.

2. Run the Jupyter Notebook: Open the Jupyter notebook:
   jupyter notebook
   

   Navigate to `Loan_Prediction.ipynb` and execute the cells to train and evaluate the model.

3. Run the Python Scripts: For command-line execution, you can use the provided scripts:

   Train_model.py
   Evaluate_model.py
  

   Ensure that you update the paths to your dataset and any hyperparameters as needed.

 ## Data

The dataset used in this project should be in CSV format and include columns relevant to loan applications (e.g., income, credit score, loan amount).
Sample data can be found in the `data/` directory under the name `Train/Test.csv`.

 ## Training

The model is trained using the `train_model.py` script. You can customize hyperparameters and model configurations within this script.

Python
python train_model.py

 ## Evaluation

After training, evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using the `evaluate_model.py` script. This script generates metrics to assess model accuracy and other performance indicators.

Python
Python evaluate_model.py
